Hi there! I'm Charlie, a DPhil Computer Science student at the University of Oxford.
My research is in the area of generative modeling for scientific applications, and is supervised by Prof. Michael Bronstein.
I'm particularly intrested in inference methods for score- and flow-based models.
This summer I interned at InstaDeep, in the Bayesian Flow Networks team.

Prior to Oxford, I studied the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, graduating with distinction.
Whilst in Cambridge my research focused on deep learning theory, and was supervised by [Dr Ferenc Husz√°r](https://www.inference.vc/).
I was particularly interested in [geometric](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/14975) and [topological](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02234) theories of generalisation.
My MPhil dissertation concerned approximate second-order optimisation, and the bias of such optimisers towards generalisation.
A variation of this project was later applied to [RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00666)
