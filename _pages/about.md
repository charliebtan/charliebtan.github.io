Hi there! I'm Charlie, a second-year DPhil Computer Science student at the University of Oxford. 
I'm interested in the overlap between generative modeling and unnormalized density sampling, particularly for scientific applications.
My research is supervised by Prof Michael Bronstein, and funded by a Departmental Studentship.

Last summer I interned at InstaDeep, working on generative protein design in the Bayesian Flow Networks team.

Prior to Oxford, I studied the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, graduating with distinction.
Whilst in Cambridge my research focused on deep learning theory, and was supervised by [Prof.&nbsp;Ferenc&nbsp;Husz√°r](https://www.inference.vc/).
I was particularly interested in [geometric](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/14975) and [topological](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02234) theories of generalisation.
My MPhil dissertation concerned approximate second-order optimisation, and the bias of such optimisers towards generalisation.
