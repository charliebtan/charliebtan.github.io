Hi there! I'm Charlie, a third-year DPhil Computer Science student at the University of Oxford. 
I'm interested in _learned samplers_ generative methods for drawing samples from the Boltzmann density of molecular systems.
My research is supervised by [Prof.&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/), and co-supervised by [Dr.&nbsp;Alex&nbsp;Tong](https://www.alextong.net). 
Our recent [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18175) explores transferable normalizing flows as a proposal for sampling.

I'm currently visiting the Mila - Quebec AI Institute, where I am hosted by [Dr.&nbsp;Kirill&nbsp;Neklyudov](https://necludov.github.io). Last summer I interned at InstaDeep, working on [generative protein sequence modelling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58250-2).

Prior to Oxford, I studied the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, graduating with distinction.
Whilst in Cambridge my research focused on deep learning theory, and was supervised by [Prof.&nbsp;Ferenc&nbsp;Husz√°r](https://www.inference.vc/).
I was particularly interested in [geometric](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/14975) and [topological](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02234) theories of generalisation.
